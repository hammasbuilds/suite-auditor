"""Run both versions of a function on the same inputs and compare.

Every non-trivial detail here was a bug first, found while building the sibling tool
`repo-surgeon`. They are all the same shape: the comparison produced a *confident wrong
answer* rather than an error, which for a review tool is the worst available failure - a
false accusation costs the reader more than silence would.

- **Separate module namespaces per version.** Defining both in one namespace and taking a
  reference to each breaks recursion: the body's self-call resolves through module globals,
  so after the second `def` shadows the name, the old function recurses into the new one
  and they appear to agree.
- **The same `__name__` for both namespaces.** A class defined inside one reprs as
  `<__name__.Foo object ...>`, so distinct names make every returned instance look like a
  difference.
- **Memory addresses normalised.** `<Foo object at 0x7f...>` reprs differently on every
  allocation; comparing raw makes any function returning a plain object a guaranteed
  "disagreement", reported with the address as proof.
- **Annotations are not evaluated.** Modules routinely annotate with names that only exist
  under `if TYPE_CHECKING:`, and evaluating them raises `NameError` on a function that is
  perfectly callable.
- **The package is importable.** Without it, a module doing `from . import x` cannot load
  at all, and the result reads "could not verify" when the truth is "nothing put the
  package on the path".
